### Installation
In order to install the code files needed to run the webpage, you will need to clone the repository from the GitHub page. From your repository page on GitHub, click the green button labeled Clone or download, and in the “Clone with HTTPs” section, copy the URL for your repository.

Next, on your local machine, open your bash shell and change your current working directory to the location where you would like to clone your repository. 

### Usage
In order to use the project once it has been installed, you should go through each of the documents of code and familiarise yourself with the content. The directory explaining the purpose of each of the files is included in the repository. It is titled 1.DirectoryPage.txt. Once you have done this, you can make changes where you see fit.
